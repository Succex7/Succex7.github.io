            <div>
                <h4>Responsive Profile Card</h4>
                <p>I built a personal profile page <strong>using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> The page is fully  responsive, adjusting smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. It featured a live clock in milliseconds, a light/dark mode toggle and a glass-morphism UI. <em>This project helped me understand media queries, layout responsiveness, and how to write clean, maintainable CSS for adaptive design.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Autorent Website</h4>
                <p>I recreated a car dealership website <strong>using only HTML and CSS</strong>, focusing on structure, design accuracy and responsiveness. <em>This project strengthened my understanding of flexbox and grid layouts, and gave me hands-on experience with replicating professional web layouts.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>E-commerce Website</h4>
                <p>I designed a modern landing page for an e-commerce website <strong>using HTML and CSS.</strong> The goal was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that highlights products effectively. <em>Through this project, I practiced layout organization, typography, and UI consistency.</em></p>
